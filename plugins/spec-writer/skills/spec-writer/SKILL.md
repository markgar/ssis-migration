# Spec Writer

Generate **implementation spec sets** that fully document the migration of SQL Server SSIS ETL packages to PySpark on Microsoft Fabric. The output is a directory of Markdown files — not code. A separate build agent will later consume these specs to produce the actual PySpark implementation.

The spec writer is the meticulous analyst who reads every SSIS data flow, every stored procedure, every table schema, and distills it into unambiguous, implementation-ready specs.

## Dependencies

This skill orchestrates two other skills from the same plugin repository:

| Skill | Used for |
|-------|----------|
| `ssis-analyzer` | Extracting control flow, data flows, execution order, SQL statements, variables, parameters, connection managers, column lineage from `.ispac` / `.dtsx` files |
| `dacpac-analyzer` | Extracting table schemas, views, stored procedures, functions, indexes, foreign keys, sequences, constraints from `.bacpac` / `.dacpac` files |

**Always use the analyzer skills** — never guess at schemas or procedure logic. The artifacts are the source of truth.

### Failure Protocol

If either analyzer skill cannot be found or loaded:

1. **STOP immediately** — do not attempt to write specs without these skills.
2. **Report the failure clearly** to the user, naming which skill(s) failed to load and directing them to the [markgar/ssis-migration](https://github.com/markgar/ssis-migration) repo for installation instructions.
3. **Do not fall back** to reading raw XML or inventing schemas. The analyzer skills are the only sanctioned way to extract artifact metadata.

Both analyzer skills require **Python 3** to run their extraction scripts. Before starting any spec work, verify Python is available by running `python3 --version` (or `python --version`). If Python is not installed or not on the PATH, stop and inform the user — the analyzers will not function without it.

## Source Material

You work from two kinds of artifacts that the user will point you to:

| Artifact | Skill to use | What you extract |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| `.ispac` / `.dtsx` (SSIS packages) | `ssis-analyzer` | Control flow, data flows, execution order, precedence constraints, SQL statements, variables, parameters, connection managers, column lineage |
| `.bacpac` / `.dacpac` (database packages) | `dacpac-analyzer` | Table schemas, views, stored procedures, functions, indexes, foreign keys, sequences, constraints |

## Spec Set Structure

Every spec set lives in a single directory and contains exactly these files:

```
<spec-dir>/
  README.md          # High-level overview of the migration
  CONSTITUTION.md    # Project-level facts shared across all specs
  01-<name>.md       # First spec (usually prerequisites/infrastructure)
  02-<name>.md       # Second spec
  03-<name>.md       # ...and so on
```

### README.md

The README is the entry point. It must contain:

1. **Title** — what this spec set migrates (e.g., "Daily ETL Specs")
2. **What it migrates** — one paragraph explaining the source system and what the SSIS package does today
3. **Specs table** — a Markdown table listing every file in the set with a one-line description, in implementation order
4. **How to use** — instructions for handing specs to the build agent (one at a time or the whole directory)
5. **Reference materials** — table listing the `.ispac`/`.bacpac` artifact paths and their purpose

Template:

```markdown
# <Title>

Ground-truth specifications for migrating <source description> from SSIS to native PySpark on Microsoft Fabric.

## What it migrates

<One paragraph: what the SSIS package does, what databases it touches, what the end result is.>

## Specs

Implement in order — each spec builds on the previous.

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `CONSTITUTION.md` | <one-line summary of shared project facts> |
| `01-<name>.md` | <one-line description> |
| `02-<name>.md` | <one-line description> |

## How to use

Select **sjd-builder** from the Copilot chat mode dropdown, then hand it specs one at a time:

\```
implement <spec-dir>/01-<name>.md
\```

Or point it at the whole directory to build everything in order:

\```
implement the spec in <spec-dir>/
\```

The agent reads `CONSTITUTION.md` for project-level facts, then works through the numbered specs in order.

## Reference materials

| Artifact | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| <e.g., OLTP schema> | <path to .bacpac> | <what it documents> |
| <e.g., SSIS package> | <path to .ispac/.dtsx> | <what it documents> |
```

### CONSTITUTION.md

The constitution contains **unchanging project-level facts** that every numbered spec inherits. It prevents repeating the same boilerplate in every spec. It must contain these sections (omit any that don't apply):

1. **Package** — package name and source/test directory layout
2. **Stack** — PySpark version, Delta Lake version, Python version, Fabric runtime version
3. **Entry Point** — the main entry file
4. **Source Database** — server, database name, driver details
5. **Destination** — target (Fabric Lakehouse Delta tables), table and column naming conventions
6. **Authentication** — table showing local vs Fabric auth mechanisms, with details for each
7. **Environment Configuration** — how the code detects local vs Fabric runtime
8. **Fabric Targets** — workspace, SJD, environment, lakehouse names
9. **Source Material** — table of `.bacpac`/`.ispac` artifact paths and their purpose (this is what the build agent uses to resolve ambiguities)
10. **Migration Context** — brief paragraph on what's being migrated and why

Keep it factual and terse. No implementation guidance — that goes in the numbered specs.

### Numbered Specs (01-xx.md, 02-xx.md, ...)

Each numbered spec documents **one pipeline stage** — typically one dimension load, one fact table load, or a set of shared prerequisites. The spec must be detailed enough that a build agent can implement it without asking questions.

#### Spec Ordering

- **01 is always prerequisites** — infrastructure tables (lineage, watermarks), seed data, shared helper functions. Everything else depends on this.
- **Dimensions before facts** — fact tables reference dimension surrogate keys, so dimensions must be loaded first.
- **Simple before complex** — start with narrow dimensions (few columns, no joins) and work toward wider ones (many columns, multiple source table joins, NULL handling).

#### Spec Internal Structure

Every numbered spec should follow this section flow. Include all sections that apply — omit only those that genuinely don't apply to this particular load.

1. **Title & Prerequisites** — spec number, name, one-line description. Callout box linking to prerequisite specs and the CONSTITUTION.

2. **SSIS Lineage** — document the original SSIS execution flow for this load. List every task in the sequence container in execution order (from precedence constraints). Name each task exactly as it appears in the SSIS package. Explain what each task does. This section is critical — it's the bridge between the original system and the new one.

3. **Source Tables** — for each source table involved, list every column with its SQL Server type, nullability, and notes (PK, FK, business key, temporal period columns). If the table is system-versioned (temporal), note its archive table.

4. **Source Extraction Logic** — document the stored procedure or query that extracts data from the source. Include:
   - **Change detection** — how the procedure identifies rows that changed since the last load (typically `ValidFrom` in a time window)
   - **Point-in-time snapshot** — if the procedure uses `FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF` or similar temporal queries, document exactly how
   - **Valid To recalculation** — if the procedure recalculates `Valid To` for SCD2 rows, show the exact SQL
   - **NULL replacement** — if the procedure applies `ISNULL`/`COALESCE` defaults, list each column and its default
   - **Known bugs** — if the original procedure has bugs (wrong column mappings, etc.), document them explicitly. The spec should replicate bugs to match existing data unless the user says otherwise.

5. **Staging Schema** — document the intermediate staging table schema on the DW side. Note that PySpark implementations typically don't need a physical staging table — this is for reference only.

6. **Destination Table** — the final target table schema. For each column: SQL Server name, type, nullability, notes. Call out columns to **omit** in the PySpark output (surrogate keys, lineage keys). Provide:
   - **Delta Table Name** — the converted name (spaces/special chars → underscores)
   - **Delta Column Names** — mapping table from SQL Server names to Delta names

7. **Column Mapping — Source to Destination** — a table showing how each output column is derived from source columns. This is the transformation specification. Include source expressions, join conditions, NULL handling, and any bugs to replicate.

8. **SCD Type 2 Merge Logic** (for dimension loads) — document the merge procedure step by step:
   - **Step 1 — Close off existing rows** — show the exact SQL that closes current SCD2 rows
   - **Step 2 — Insert new rows** — show the exact SQL that inserts staging rows
   - Explain how this translates to a Delta `MERGE` operation (match condition, when matched, insert)
   - **Step 3 — Update lineage and advance cutoff** — the post-merge audit trail updates

9. **Watermark / Incremental Strategy** — where the watermark is stored, how it's read before extraction, how it's advanced after a successful merge, and what the seed value is for initial loads.

10. **PySpark Source Query** — since temporal queries (`FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF`) must run on SQL Server, document the JDBC pushdown strategy. Offer both options when applicable:
    - **Option A** — call the stored procedure via JDBC
    - **Option B** — inline the query (for when the procedure doesn't exist on the source)

11. **Testing** — describe the test strategy:
    - Where to source test data (which databases/tables to query for sample fixtures)
    - Test structure (input fixtures, expected output, comparison keys)
    - Coverage cases to include (NULL vs non-NULL, edge cases, idempotency)

## Process

When asked to create a spec set, start by gathering context. Do NOT jump straight into analysis — you need answers first.

### Step 0 — Information Gathering

Before you can write specs, you need specific information that only the user can provide. Ask for everything you're missing in a single, organized message.

**What you can discover yourself** (from the workspace and artifacts — do NOT ask the user for these):
- `.ispac`/`.dtsx`/`.bacpac`/`.dacpac` file paths — search the workspace
- Table schemas, stored procedures, column types — extract from `.bacpac`/`.dacpac` via `dacpac-analyzer`
- SSIS control flow, data flows, execution order, SQL statements — extract from `.ispac`/`.dtsx` via `ssis-analyzer`

**What you MUST ask the user** (cannot be discovered from artifacts):

| Information | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| **Package name** | `daily_etl` |
| **Target spec directory** | `specs/daily-etl/` |
| **Source database server** | `sql-prod-01.company.com` |
| **Source database name** | `WideWorldImporters` |
| **Fabric workspace name** | `my-fabric-workspace` |
| **Fabric lakehouse name** | `bronze-lakehouse` |
| **Fabric SJD name** | `daily-etl-sjd` |
| **Fabric environment name** | `daily-etl-env` |
| **PySpark / Python version** | `PySpark 3.5 / Python 3.11` |
| **Fabric runtime version** | `1.3` |
| **Auth mechanism (local)** | `SQL auth with env vars` |
| **Auth mechanism (Fabric)** | `Managed Identity / token provider` |

Present this table and ask the user to fill in the values. If the user doesn't know some values yet, mark them as `TBD` in the CONSTITUTION and proceed with the rest of the spec work.

**If the user just says "help me build a spec"** with no other context:
1. First, search the workspace for `.ispac`, `.dtsx`, `.bacpac`, and `.dacpac` files
2. If you find artifacts, list them and ask the user to confirm which ones to use
3. Then ask for the project-specific values from the table above
4. Only after you have answers (or explicit TBDs) should you proceed to analysis

### Step 1 — Identify Source Artifacts

Ask the user to confirm the paths to `.ispac`/`.bacpac` files if not already provided.

### Step 2 — Analyze the SSIS package

Use the `ssis-analyzer` skill to extract:
   - The main control flow and execution order
   - Each sequence container and its inner tasks
   - All data flows with column lineage
   - SQL statements in Execute SQL tasks
   - Connection managers and their targets
   - Variables and parameters

#### Multi-package `.ispac` handling

An `.ispac` may contain multiple `.dtsx` packages. After initial analysis, determine whether the packages form **one orchestrated process** (a master package that calls child packages via Execute Package tasks) or **independent processes** that don't reference each other.

- **Orchestrated** — treat the master package as the control flow and produce a single spec set that covers the full pipeline.
- **Independent** — produce a **separate spec set** (separate directory, separate README/CONSTITUTION) for each independent package.
- **Unclear** — if the relationship between packages is ambiguous, present your findings to the user and ask for clarification before proceeding.

### Step 3 — Analyze the database schemas

Use the `dacpac-analyzer` skill to extract:
   - All tables referenced by the SSIS package (source and destination)
   - Stored procedures called by the SSIS package (extraction procs, merge procs)
   - Views, functions, and sequences used in the ETL
   - Foreign key relationships for understanding joins

### Step 4 — Plan the spec set

Based on the SSIS analysis:
   - Identify each distinct load (dimension, fact, prerequisite)
   - Determine the execution order from SSIS precedence constraints
   - Group related tasks into numbered specs
   - Use the todo tool to lay out your plan and get confirmation

### Step 5 — Write the CONSTITUTION first

Fill in every applicable section using the values gathered in Step 0. Leave nothing ambiguous about the project-level facts. If any values were marked TBD, note them clearly.

### Step 6 — Write each numbered spec

Work through them in order. For each:
   - Start with the SSIS lineage section — trace the exact execution flow
   - Document every source table schema from the `.bacpac`
   - Reproduce the extraction procedure logic from the `.bacpac` or `.ispac`
   - Document the staging and destination schemas from the DW `.bacpac`
   - Build the column mapping by cross-referencing source → staging → destination
   - Document the merge procedure step by step
   - Flag any bugs in the original procedure
   - Write the testing section

### Step 7 — Write the README last

It summarizes what you've already written.

## Constraints

- **DO NOT write PySpark code.** You write specs, not implementations.
- **DO NOT invent schemas.** Every table schema, column type, and procedure must come from analyzing the actual `.bacpac`/`.ispac` artifacts.
- **DO NOT skip the SSIS lineage section.** This is the anchor that proves the spec accurately reflects the original system.
- **DO NOT combine unrelated loads into one spec.** Each dimension or fact table gets its own numbered spec file.
- **DO NOT omit known bugs.** If the original stored procedure has a bug (wrong column mapping, missing join, etc.), document it explicitly and instruct the build agent to replicate it.
- **DO NOT hardcode environment-specific values in numbered specs.** Those go in the CONSTITUTION. Numbered specs reference the CONSTITUTION for connection details, package name, auth patterns, etc.
